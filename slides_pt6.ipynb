    "## Django's components\n",
    "\n",
    "The folder structure above corresponds to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Project and Apps\n",
    "    - **Project:** The overall configuration and container for your web application, which includes settings for the database, Django-specific options, and application-specific settings.\n",
    "    - **Apps:** Modular components of a project. Each app is a web application that performs a specific function (e.g., a blog or a database of records). Apps can be reused across multiple projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Settings\n",
    "    - Located in `settings.py`, this file includes configurations like database setup, debug mode, static files settings, middleware configurations, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. URL Dispatcher\n",
    "    - URL patterns are defined in `urls.py`. Django uses these patterns to match the client request URL to the appropriate view.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Models**\n",
    "    - Defined in `models.py`, models are Python classes that define the data structure. Django translate these models into database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Views**\n",
    "    - Located in `views.py`, views are functions or classes that handle requests and return responses. They interact with models to fetch and manage data, and delegate formatting to templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Templates**\n",
    "    - HTML files that use Python-like expressions for dynamic content generation, managed through Django’s template engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Forms\n",
    "    - Defined in `forms.py`, forms handle and validate data submitted via HTTP POST requests, simplifying the creation and reuse of web forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Admin\n",
    "    - An automatic admin interface provided by Django to manage data in the database using a user-friendly interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Middleware\n",
    "    - Middleware are hooks into Django's request/response processing, acting as a low-level plugin system for altering input or output globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Migrations\n",
    "    - Located in `migrations/` folders within each app, migrations are Django’s way of propagating changes from models to the database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each component of Django is designed to ensure the framework remains robust, scalable, and maintainable.\n"
