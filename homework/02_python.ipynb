    "In this assignment, you will work with financial data from a CSV file and use Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze and visualize the data. The data is stored in a file named 02_python_data.csv, which contains daily stock prices for various companies listed on Deutsche BÃ¶rse (Xetra). The columns are labeled with Reuters identifier code (RIC). The first RIC '.GDAXI' is the german DAX index, the remaining RICs represent its constituents.\n",
